First Make sure Ping is working on 209.58.189.219

Second, Initiate this command to enter karaf shell

ssh -p 22 root@209.58.189.219 "bash odl.sh"

"The password is 12345abcde" (this is the password for that server)

Karaf should initiate

Then install these features under Karaf manually and wait until they all finish (It may take 9 -10 minutes)

feature:install odl-restconf odl-l2switch-switch odl-mdsal-apidocs odl-dlux-all odl-openflowplugin-flow-services odl-openflowplugin-drop-test


Finally initiate mininet to test the controller from your PC


sudo mn --topo=single,4 --controller remote,ip=209.58.189.219,port=6633
